# Movie Ticket Booking Simulation

## Summary:

Our project is a simulation of a movie ticket booking system.
The **salient features** of our projects are:    

1.   An active login system with real time updation of user data.   

2.  An interactive menu system to navigate through the program.   

3. Extensive database management using Mysql for personalised user profiles.

## Pre-requisites:
Before executing "main.c", you need to perform the following actions:
1. Installation of 'MySQL' in the system.
2. The password for the user 'root' should be set to "Gaur@123#".
3. Execute 'movie_database.sql' query script to create the required databases and tables in it.
4. MySQL header files and libraries must be included as path in the compiler.
5. 'libmysql.dll' must be included in the project folder.
6. -lmysql should be added to the linker.

Now you may execute "main.c" program :)
